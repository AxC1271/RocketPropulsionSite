Just for the sake of my sanity and making sure I do not forget any basics:

- Make sure to set up the backend email.js
for this particular form, otherwise it's completely useless

- Make a separate page that shows the email submission request being fulfilled (green checkmark)

- Make the message text-box multi-lined (that's for future me to figure out)

- Consider using framer-motion for the contact forms + any of the section cards
